\section{Question 1}
Disintermediation is the process of removing the intermediates in the supply chain. Or "cutting out the middle man". 

The benefit of disintermediation includes:
Higher market transparency;
Lower cost;
Faster etc.

It's very easy for buyers and sellers to find each other in a transparent environment. However, some goods can not be easily trade online. For example, when buying clothes, which fitting and personal liking is required, it's necessary for buyers to physically try on.

Reintermediation means reintroduction of intermediates between users and producers.

The benefit of reintermediation includes:
lower cost for small order;
better customer service experience;
better 3rd party web services etc.
